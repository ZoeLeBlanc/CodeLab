## Homework for Week 4

## Coding Assignment 1: Pick Pair Programmers

Given a hard-coded set of 6 names, write a program that randomly assigns everyone a partner and returns the data as a list of 3 tuples, each representing a pair of programmers. Must return a different, correct result each time!

Example:
```python
names = ["Catherine","Cho", "Chris", "Eleanore", "Emily","Matilda"]
# Your code here
print(schedule)
```


## Coding Assignment 2: Double check!

Given a hard-coded set of 6 names and a list of 3 tuples (the same output format of assignment 1), check whether the list represents a valid and correct pairing of programmers given the 6 names. What error conditions are you checking for?

Example:
```python
names = ["Catherine","Cho", "Chris", "Eleanore", "Emily","Matilda"]
schedule = [("Chris","Emily"),("Eleanore","Cho"),("Cho", "Catherine"),("Catherine","Matilda")]
# Your code here
print("This is a valid pairing: " + is_valid)
```

## Coding Assignment 3: List of Sums

Given a list of integers and a target integer, find the integer pairs in the list that add up to the target.

Example:
```python
input = [1,5,7,9,11,15,19,27]
target = 12
# Your code here
# For the above example, should return (5,7) and (1,11)
```
