### What is Code Lab ?
- Basic technical curriculum for digital humanists
- Help you learn everything from how computer executes code to writing programs, and from building websites to basic data analysis |
---
### Why code?
- Coding is only a part of what digital humanists do. Most DH practioners don't do any.
- BUT coding is a powerful tool for digital humanities projects and scholarship |
- So coding can empower you! |
---
### Why code?
- "Hack" vs "Yack" or: how is DH work done?
- "Collaboration" vs Collaboration |
- What is Yack (in a DH context) without Hack? |
- RZT: If you can't build it, you don't really understand it. |
