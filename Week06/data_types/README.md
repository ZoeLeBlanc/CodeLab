# DATA TYPES & VARIABLES

In this script, answer the following prompts:

1. Create a *variable* and assign it any value you want

1. When the script runs have the value of the variable *output* to your terminal

---
1. Create four more variables and *assign* them each a distinct *data type* (**hint: integers are data types**)

1. When the script runs, output the data *type* of each variable (**hint: try searching for a method in python to check data types**)

---
1. Decide which three out the four variables that you created can use *concatenation* and then join them with more data, and output those values (**hint: concatenation is a fancy word for adding things together**)

2. Comparing two pairs of the variables you created, output their *equality*
