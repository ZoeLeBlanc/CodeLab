# Data Flow

Computers read code line by line, top to bottom of a script. But what if you want to have code run not in sequential order, or you want your code to do something depending on a value, or you want to reuse your code and run it multiple times?

We can solve all those problems with data flow structures.

#### For Loops
**For Loops** are one of the most common ways in python to loop over a sequence.

We've already used for loops in lists before, like this:
```python
slab = ['Zoe', 'Shane', 'Brandon']

for person in scholars_lab:
    print(person) # This should print out each person's name individually
```

We can also use For Loops on dictionaries. The syntax is slightly different because dictionaries are not one long sequence, but rather a sequence of key/value pairs.
```python
scholars_lab = {
    'employee_1': {
        'name':'Zoe',
        'DH_methods': ['gifs', 'data visualization', 'web apps']
    },
    'employee_2': {
        'name':'Shane',
        'DH_methods': ['programming_genius', 'TEI']
    },
}
for key, value in scholars_lab.items():
    print('key', key)
    print('value', value)
```
This script should print out each of the employee keys and then the dictionaries those keys contain.


#### Conditionals
Earlier we learned about *booleans* (`True or False`). In Python, we can test the truth value of code to decide how we want our code to run.

Taking our list again, instead of printing out each name. Let's only print if the name equals Zoe.
```python
slab = ['Zoe', 'Shane', 'Brandon']

for person in scholars_lab:
    if person == 'Zoe':
        print(person)
```


We can also test the equality of two variables in an if statement:
```python
witch = 'Hermione'
if wizard != witch:
    print('well done')
else:
    print('nice try')
```

In this example, we're getting a bit more tricky.
Let's break it down with a simpler example.
```python
test1 = True
test2 = False
print(test1 == test2)
print(test1 != test2)
three = 3
four = 4
print(three < four)
print(four > three)
```

#### Functions
 Essentially functions are a way to wrap your code into blocks so that way you can call your code when you need it to run.

```python
def get_fundamentals():
    fundamentals = 'Having fun'
    print(fundamentals)
    return fundamentals

get_fundamentals()
```

Some more advanced examples:
```python
def new_costume(halloween_costumes):
    costumes = halloween_costumes + 'Black Panther'
    return costumes

updated_costumes = new_costume(halloween_costumes)
```

Combining everything together:
```python
def check_costumes(costumes):
    for costume in costumes:
        if costume == 'Black Panther':
            print("That's your costume " + costume)
        else:
            print("Back to the drawing board")
check_costumes(updated_costumes)
```
