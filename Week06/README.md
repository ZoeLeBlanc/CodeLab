Two assignments this week, each with bonus sections. Focus on completing the main part of each assignment before worrying about bonus functionality.

##### Assignment 1
'The Project Gutenberg EBook of Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org Title: Pride and Prejudice Author: Jane Austen Posting Date: August 26, 2008 [EBook #1342] Release Date: June, 1998 Last Updated: March 10, 2018 Language: English Character set encoding: UTF-8 *** START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PRIDE AND PREJUDICE ***Produced by Anonymous Volunteers PRIDE AND PREJUDICE By Jane Austen Chapter 1 It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
'
This is the first few lines from Project Gutenberg version of Jane Austen, which you can find [here](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1342/1342-0.txt).

We want to use this text, but we need to get rid of some of the metadata at the beginning and we want to replace some of the data. Create a script called `jane_austen_data_munging.py`

1. First save this text into a variable called `jane`
1. Figure out how to get rid of everything before `Produced by Anonymous Volunteers` and save everything after in a variable called `jane_cleaned`
2. Create a variable called `jane_sort` and store the words in `jane_cleaned` in alphabetical order
3. Replace all instances of `man` with `person`, and `wife` with `parther` in `jane_cleaned`

BONUS:
4. Change your script so that you can replace any word in the text with any other word. 

##### Assignment 2

Famous Canadians üçÅ

As a Canadian, I like to talk a lot about famous Canadians. Here's a website with lots of Canadians [https://www.biography.com/people/groups/famous-canadians](https://www.biography.com/people/groups/famous-canadians)

But I have some favorites that I want to have on hand quickly. Here's my quickie list with their names, birth year, death year, and their professions.

Celine Dion, 1968, performer, goddess
Drake, 1986, performer
Justin Trudeau, 1971, Prime Minister, snowboard instructor
Sandra Oh, 1971, actor, goddess
Nathan Fillion, 1971, actor
John A. Macdonald, 1815, 1891, Prime Minister


1. Create a script and find the best way to store my famous canadians. You've learned a few ways so far to store information like this so feel free to try a few, but remember go for whatever is easiest and works.

2. Figure out a way to output all the information for people that share the same profession. Remember to use for loops and conditions!

3. Add `nationality` to each person's information and set the value to Canadian, just in case I decide I like people from other countries.

**BONUS**
4. Create a way to input any value and return any person that matches it. If no one matches return `There's probably a Canadian that does this`
