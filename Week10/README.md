In this assignment, you'll have more freedom to experiment but also that requires you to take more initiative. We want you to bring in as much as you've learned with CodeLab, but also to decide what is relevant to this assignment.

For this project, we want you to find a website that has public domain materials (whether project gutenberg, wikipedia, etc... ).

1. Get the public domain materials from that site with web scraping

2. Using python libraries and methods, and DO SOMETHING with the sources.
    Some ideas:
    - remix the sources in a way that transforms the public domain sources in a new way
    - analyze the sources to find patterns

3. Present what you've created on an html page.
